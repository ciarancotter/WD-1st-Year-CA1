        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Waluigi Restaurant and Social Club is a high-end exotic dinery that caters to the upper class, with a special section for UCC Quercus 
            scholars who feel the need to bring up their Quercus scholarship every five minutes. The history of Waluigi Restaurant stretches all
            the way back to March 2021, when Waluigi decided to shun the world and open a fine eatery. Such was his prowess at cooking that people
            flocked from all over Cork to his restaurant. When they couldn't pay, he loaned them Waluigi Dollars, which can be loaned in unlimited 
            quantities with the clause that anyone who takes out a loan of Waluigi Dollars from Waluigi Restaurant immediately and irrevocably owes the majority stake 
            of their soul to Ciar√°n Cotter. Anyhow, moving on to more important things - it will please you to know that Waluigi serves his enemies
            as dishes out of sheer spite. He also comes after those who can't repay their loans. You will discover that one such unfortunate victim 
            is now on the menu for 4.99.
